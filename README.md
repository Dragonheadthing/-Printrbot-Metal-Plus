My custom configuration file for the PrintBot Metal Plus 3d printer. Modified Marlin 2.1.2.4 firmware downloaded directly from https://marlinfw.org/meta/download/. I was able to find configuration files for similar printers from the company Printrbot, but not the exactly Metal Plus model. I marked the areas of the files that I edited with “Edited.” I’m still tweaking some settings. The only thing I have modified from the original Metal Plus was replace the Z-axis couplers. My model currently has mainboard Printrboard Rev. F4.
